        <p class="lead mb-4">I’m Bonnie Yang, and I am currently studying pre Business at UC Riverside. I moved to the United States when I was in middle school, and now my family and I lived in San Diego. I started to learn piano and clarinet since I was a child because I was interested in music. I went to various places to perform and compete. When I was in high school, I found that I seemed to have some kind of interest in business, so I started to look for clubs outside, and I wanted to know more about business. At first, I was interested in sales because I am a person who likes to be out and socialize, so I think this may be more suitable for my job, but when I am about to graduate, I find that I am more enthusiastic about finance than sales. This is why I chose finance for my major in college. I’m a freshman, but I tried to find a few high school internships to confirm whether I like a business. I tried different business fields, and I think this is interesting. For my personality, it should also be particularly suitable for my needs. Talking more socially with others can also train my eloquence.<br><br>

        I’m Taiwanese, and I grew up in Taiwan, either. Since I move to the United States, it changes a lot. The cultural differences and all the different school environments give me many challenges when I first got here. I think I have experienced a lot of things along the way. From being unfamiliar with anything and language at the beginning to now knowing part of English is a lot of room for improvement. At first, I was a little bit resistant to learning English, but I gradually let go of this part because of my factors because I got used to it slowly. This also brought me some features that I should learn from others and made me better.<br><br>

        After coming to the U.S., I found that I like to travel and I like to go to various places to see nature. Look at different locations and give people different feelings. Every time I go to a new home, I will sigh for its beauty and natural scenery. The photos taken by the camera are far less than what you can see with the naked eye. But because our family likes to travel, we often go to different places to visit. As long as there are holidays, we will walk around and see when we are in the car or every time. I feel delighted when I go to place. Whenever we go to a new home, my dad will explain this place’s historical story and learn some knowledge while traveling. I didn’t like to travel with my family before, but I grew up slowly. When I started to enjoy traveling with my family, in my cognition, I felt that the moment belonged to my time with my family and was very happy.
